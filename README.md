# Student Record System

## Background
me: "Write the specification for a very simple, beginner Java project which uses classes and methods and testing"

ChatGPT: "Sure, here's an example specification for a simple Java project:

Project Name: Student Record System

Description: A program that stores student information such as name, ID, and grades, and allows users to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the records.

Functional Requirements:
- The program should allow users to add new student records to the system, including name, ID, and grades.
- The program should allow users to view all existing student records in the system, including name, ID, and grades.
- The program should allow users to update an existing student record, including changing name, ID, and/or grades.
- The program should allow users to delete an existing student record from the system.
- The program should be able to store the student records persistently, for example in a text file.

Non-functional Requirements:
- The program should be written in Java, using object-oriented programming principles.
- The program should include at least one class to represent a student record, and methods for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting records.
- The program should include basic error handling, such as preventing duplicate student records or invalid input.
- The program should include a testing suite that tests each method's functionality and edge cases.
- The program should be well-documented, with clear comments and an explanation of each method's purpose and expected behavior.

Deliverables:
- Source code for the program, written in Java and committed to a public Github repository.
- A README file that includes instructions on how to run the program, a description of the program's purpose and functionality, and a summary of how to use each of the program's features.
- A testing suite that tests each method's functionality and edge cases.

Timeline:
- 1-2 weeks, depending on the developer's experience level and availability.

Assumptions:
- The user has access to a command line interface and a Java development environment (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans).
- The user has basic knowledge of object-oriented programming principles and Java syntax."
